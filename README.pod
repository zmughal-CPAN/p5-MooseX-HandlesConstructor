    has header => ( is => 'rw',

    #         };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When using Moo or Moose handles that provide an accessor handle on an
attribute, it may make sense to pass the name of handles to the constructor to
simplify the API. Using this module will get all curried accessor handles
defined in a class and allow setting them when calling C<->new()>
